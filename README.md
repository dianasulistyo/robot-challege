# robot-challenge

#### Run Application
```java ChallengeApplication```
#### Run test
```gradle test```
##### Note
* Due to requirement, I need to  flip the position of y so that coordinate 0,0 is on the South West.
* There should be more resilient into this application, such as user input should be able to receive lower cases
and should check if multiple robots not in the same position (but I'm not sure if they should be able to be in the same position)
